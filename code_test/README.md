# Code test

This was a code test I did while applying for a programming job at Genscape.  I did well at the test, but only lasted 6 months in the job.  None of the skills needed for the test were relevant to the job.

Start by reading the [question](question.md), and take a look at my [solutions](code_test.md).  Recently my coworker challenged me to write
a [parser](parser.md) for the data structure in the question, so you can look at a nice example of a parser combinator in perl, that does
something different to "a binary calculator".

And since I now have the input end of graphviz rewritten, I should probably write the graph end, and have a useable, cross-platform graph library that isn't a a misery to install.
