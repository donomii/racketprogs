; Port Relay
;
; Listen on a port, and relay all connections to a different port
;
; Optional: save all the data that is relayed to log files.  
; Two files will be created per connection, a "server" and 
; "client" file, with a unique number for that connection.
;
; To save the traffic, set capture_traffic to #t, and set 
; log_dir to the directory you want to save the files to.
